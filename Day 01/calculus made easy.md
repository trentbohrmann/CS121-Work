Simplest Cases
===============
*Summary.* Let's see how far we have got. We

have arrived at the following rule: To differentiate

$x^n$, multiply by the power and reduce the power by

one, so giving us $nx^{n-1}$ as the result.

*Excersizes I.* (See p.254 for Answers.)

Differentiate the following:

(1) $y=x^{13}$     (2) $y=x^{-3/2}$

(3) $y=x^{2a}$     (4) $u=t^{2*4}$

(5) $z=\sqrt[3]{(u)}$         (6)$y=\sqrt[3]{x^{-5}}$

(7)$u=\sqrt[5]\frac{1}{x^8}$            (8)$y=2x^a$

(9)$y=\sqrt[q]{x^3}$            (10)$y=\sqrt[n]\frac{1}{x^m}$

*You have now learned how to differentiate powers*

*of x. How easy it is!*
