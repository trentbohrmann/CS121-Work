Computing = transorming inputs into outputs
algorithm = set of steps using existing operators to perform a computation

 Classes of states: numerics, character strings, logicals, functions all consist of the things that go into the other part of classes which are lists, vectors, matrices, arrays and data frames
 
syntax: return(), function invocation, { }, if/else(),loop[break is how to terminate the loop], while, for, <<-["permanentely" change an input], reserved words[if, while, function, repeat, else, break] 

operators: paste(), grep(), join(), sample(), polygon(), et cetera

other languages: latex[ _, \frac{}{},] , HTML[div class= "span4"...<\div], markdown

grep examples: "[a/b]" is there an a or b in there?

inputs/outputs: bring in files [read.jpeg, read.csv(),cat,]
